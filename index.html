 * Traditional Somfy remotes work within 400Mhz ISM band, which makes it difficult
 * to control elements from e.g. mobile phone or computer.
 *
 * ESP8266 Wifi Module embeds a whole http server functionality hence its
 * interfaces can be controlled through a WLAN enabled device with Web Browser, it is
 * a good candidate to be used as an emulator for Somfy branded remotes.
 * For that purpose it needs to control an appropriate radio module within 400Mhz band.
 *
 * In this project an RFM69 module is used, bought from some online electronic store. It
 * is controlled via SPI interface.

 * ..also controllable via apple's voice control Siri using homebridge.....-
